**Setup Instructions Windows/Whatever**

1. Download the latest Adobe Air SDK from http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html
2. Install it and add the bin directory to your `$PATH`.
3. Clone this repository add run `adl app.xml` from on your local development computer to start the application.
4. There is no `console.log()` which sucks. Use `air.trace()` instead for logging.
